    introductionHook: "Here's the thing about electric bikes—they're everywhere now. Your neighbor's got one. That guy at the coffee shop who's always too chipper at 7 AM? Definitely riding an e-bike. And you're standing there, wallet in hand, wondering if dropping a couple grand on what's essentially a bicycle with a battery is actually a smart move or just another expensive impulse buy you'll regret like that bread maker gathering dust in your pantry.",
    snippetAnswer: "Electric bikes are worth it if you commute 5-15 miles regularly, want to arrive sweat-free, or need a car alternative that pays for itself in 1-2 years through gas savings. They're not worth it if you rarely bike, live somewhere flat with short distances, or already have a reliable cheap commute. Budget $1,000-$3,000 for quality models that'll actually last.",
    roadmap: "Look, I'm not here to sell you an electric bike—I'm here to help you figure out if it makes sense for your life and your wallet. We'll break down the real costs (not just the sticker price), who actually benefits from these things, when you should definitely skip it, and how to choose one if you decide to take the plunge. No fluff, no corporate speak, just straight talk about whether an e-bike deserves a spot in your garage.",

    contextHeading: "Answering Your Other Questions About Electric Bikes",
    contextFAQs: [
      {
        question: "How long do electric bikes actually last?",
        answer: "The frame and components last 10-15 years like regular bikes, but the motor and battery are the wildcards. Quality motors from Bosch or Shimano typically last 5-10 years or 10,000-20,000 miles. Batteries need replacement every 3-5 years (500-1,000 charge cycles). Expect to spend $400-800 on a new battery at some point. With proper maintenance, your e-bike can easily last a decade, but budget for that battery replacement. The electronics are the weak point—cheaper brands with no-name motors often fail within 1-2 years.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I ride an electric bike in the rain?",
        answer: "Yes, but with caveats. E-bikes are weather-resistant, not waterproof. Light rain and normal wet conditions are fine—the electronics are sealed enough for typical use. Heavy downpours, deep puddles, and pressure washing can damage components. Riding in rain is safe; leaving your e-bike outside in storms or washing it with a hose isn't. Invest in fenders ($40-80) and cover the display when parked. Most motor and battery failures from water happen during cleaning or storage, not riding.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a license or insurance for an electric bike?",
        answer: "In most US states, no license is required for Class 1 and 2 e-bikes (those limited to 20 mph with pedal assist or throttle). Class 3 e-bikes (28 mph) may require age minimums (typically 16+) but rarely need licenses. However, insurance is smart even if not required. Homeowner's insurance often covers bikes up to $1,000-2,000, but you'll want additional coverage for expensive e-bikes. Standalone e-bike insurance costs $10-30 monthly and covers theft, damage, and liability. Laws vary by state and city, so check local regulations before buying.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the real-world range on a single charge?",
        answer: "Manufacturer claims are wildly optimistic. Realistically, expect 20-40 miles per charge depending on assist level, terrain, rider weight, and weather. Using maximum assist on hills with a heavy load, you might get 15-25 miles. On flat terrain with minimal assist, 40-60 miles is possible. Cold weather reduces range by 20-30%. Most commuters charge nightly regardless of range—the question isn't 'can I make it home' but 'do I want to deal with range anxiety.' Bigger batteries (500+ watt-hours) give peace of mind more than actual extended range for most people.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are electric bikes good exercise or just cheating?",
        answer: "It's exercise with an asterisk. Studies show e-bike riders burn 400-500 calories per hour versus 600-700 on regular bikes—you're still working, just less hard. The key difference: e-bike owners ride 3-4 times more frequently because it's not exhausting, so total weekly exercise often exceeds what regular bikers get. You're trading intensity for consistency. If your alternative is driving (zero exercise), an e-bike is vastly better. If you're already cycling regularly and want maximum fitness gains, stick with regular bikes. For most people, moderate exercise you actually do beats intense exercise you avoid.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if the battery dies while I'm riding?",
        answer: "You're pedaling a very heavy, very expensive regular bike home. Most e-bikes weigh 50-70 pounds without motor assist—about twice what normal bikes weigh. It's rideable but not fun, especially uphill. This is why experienced riders never drain batteries completely and always keep chargers accessible. The good news: batteries don't die suddenly like phones. You'll have declining assist over 10-15 miles, giving warning. Many riders keep a portable charger at work or buy a second battery ($400-800) for long-range peace of mind. Bottom line: plan your range conservatively.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I still get a good workout on an electric bike?",
        answer: "Absolutely, if you want one. Most e-bikes have 3-5 assist levels, and you control the intensity. Want a workout? Use eco mode or turn assist off entirely. Need to cruise? Max out the assist. Smart riders use high assist for morning commutes (arrive fresh) and lower assist heading home (get exercise). You're still pedaling continuously, just with help. Heart rate studies show e-bike riders maintain 60-75% max heart rate—solid cardio zone. It's not spin class intensity, but it's legitimate moderate exercise that happens daily instead of occasionally.",
